/*
Given an array arr[] denoting heights of n towers and a positive integer k.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by k
Decrease the height of the tower by k
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by k for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.
